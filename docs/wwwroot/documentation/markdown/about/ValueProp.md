# Value proposition for developers
If you are a developer we think you are going to love adaptive cards, and here's why.

## Content producers
If you are a developer who wants to create content:

* **One card** - You get one format, minimizing the cost of creating a card and maximizing the number of places it can be used.
* **Richer Expression** - Your content can more closely align with want you want to say because you have a richer palette to paint with.
* **Broader Reach** - Your content will work across a broader set of applications without you having to learn new schemas.
* **Better tooling** - Because there is a shared card ecosystem, better tooling can be created and shared by everyone.

## Content consumers
If you are a developer who owns an application:

* **Easy to implement** - You get off-the-shelf libraries to integrate easily.
* **Consistent user experience** - You get a consistent experience because you own the style of the rendered card.
* **Native performance** - You get native performance because adaptive cards target the UI framework directly.
* **Safe** - Content is delivered in safe payloads. You don't have to open the UI framework to raw HTML.
* **Free documentation** - You save time because you don't have invent schema, then document the schema, and then create tooling, and so on. <!-- not sure how this qualifies as free documentation - did you mean "documentation-free"? as in no docs required? -->
* **Shared tooling** - You save time because you don't have to create tooling for a schema.
