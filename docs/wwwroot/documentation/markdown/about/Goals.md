# Goals 

Adaptive cards should be:

* **Portable** - to any device and UI framework.
* **Open** - Libraries and schema are open source and shared.
* **Automatically Styled** to the host application's UX and brand guidelines.
* **Low cost** - Easy to define, easy to consume.
* **Expressive** - Targeted at the long tail of content that developers want to produce.
* **Purely declarative** - No code is needed or allowed.
