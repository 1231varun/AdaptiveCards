# Libraries for creating cards

(To be written.)

Please see the README for now.
## Libraries
You can use any tooling that you want to create the adaptive card json.  To make it easier to manipulate adaptive cards we hve created several libraries which define a strongly typed object model. 

C# 
* nuget 

Javascript/Typescript
* npm
