# Adaptive Cards Xamarin Bindings #

This folder contains the [Xamarin](https://xamarin.com) bindings for [Adaptive Cards](https://adaptivecards/io) for iOS and Android. These bindings enable you to build C# Xamarin applications leveraging the native implementation of Adaptive Cards on each platform.

### Contents ###
1. [AdaptiveCards.Rendering.Xamarin.Android](AdaptiveCards.Rendering.Xamarin.Android) contains the source for Xamarin Android bindings.
1. [AdaptiveCards.Rendering.Xamarin.Android.Sample](AdaptiveCards.Rendering.Xamarin.Android.Sample) contains a sample application showing the usage of the Android bindings

These are native C# bindings, exposing the native Java and Objective-C bindings to developers and not Xamarin.Forms bindings. The APIs for each platform will be different.
